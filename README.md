## Up to date Windows 10 Keylogger built using visual studio 2019

 * Features: enable/disable, exit, app/index.html for heatmap gen

 * Generates a file called KLogger.exe
 * KLogger.exe generates a klog.csv, klog.txt & klog_full.txt file
 * klog.csv can be imported into most modern spreadsheet apps
 * ex: (Google Sheets, Micorsoft Excel, Libre Office Calc, ...)
 * I recommend Libre Office Calc for privacy reasons.
 * You can then build visual graphs and such for personal use, or sort data.

### Notes on Heat Map Generator

 * launch the app/index.html in Firefox browser
 * input (easily via copy/paste) the klog.txt per app or klog_full.txt
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes
 * ^ values are decimal form of these windows hexidecimal virtual key codes

#### I initially made this for gaming but it has many uses if needed.
